# .gitignore for ASP.NET MVC / Windows Azure development
# Original file: https://gist.github.com/3318347 by @codingoutloud
## Github doc on ignoring files: https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files
## The man page for .gitignore (referenced by github): http://man.cx/gitignore
## Of possible interest (can be complex): https://github.com/github/gitignore
 
# Troubleshooting
# 1. If you add a .gitignore file to an existing repo (or significantly change one), you may want 
# to force it to act as though the new/updated .gitignore was in force the whole time. 
## http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1139762/gitignore-file-not-ignoring
### git rm -r --cached .
### git add .
### git commit -m ".gitignore is now working"
# 2. If you get an Unsynchronized Commit error in the GitHub Windows client, you may want to try this.
## http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8174324/github-unsynchronized-commit
# 3. If you get "unstaged changes" "you cannot sync with unstaged changes" "please commit your changes and try again" from 
#    Github for Windows client...

# don't ignore myself!

# Access Control Service integration (via FedUtil or Add STS Reference from VS2010) will create FederationMetadata.xml below this folder
##=> looks like FederationMetadata.xml is referenced in csproj, so need it in source control

## Multiple applications of FedUtil will result in *.backup.1, *.backup.2, etc., files for Web.config and FederationMetadata.xml
